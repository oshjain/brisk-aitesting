# brisk-aitesting Status

This package is an alpha release. It already runs real checks, but we are still building toward the larger vision.

The current accepted real-AI application baseline is 0/300 required connected
scenarios: Directus 0/100, Medusa 0/100, and n8n 0/100. One historical Directus
API journey passed but lacks the stricter raw-response digest/token record and
therefore is not counted. Real UI, database-behaviour,
contract-drift, load, stress, and soak proof is still 0. See the
[world-class real validation gate](engineering/WORLD_CLASS_REAL_VALIDATION_GATE.md).

The rule is simple: AI can suggest what to test, but Brisk checks the plan before anything runs. Engines do the execution. Evidence records what happened.

## Built

- Strict non-executable AI intent contract: `brisk-aitesting.intent.v1`.

- Optional Schemathesis OpenAPI deep API checker and run report: `brisk-aitesting.schemathesis-smoke.v1`.
- Schemathesis adapter readiness now requires real event evidence, selected operations, successful scenarios, saved artifacts, CI workflow wiring, docs, package inclusion, and plugin quality proof.

- Append-only run journal, next-invocation recovery of interrupted runs, contained engine failures, observer isolation, cleanup operation reporting, and atomic final result writes.
- Authoritative mutation validation through OpenAPI operations or typed host/runtime operation adapters.
- JSON Schema structured-output requests for compatible AI providers, followed by deterministic contract and semantic validation.

## Partly Built

- The semantic compiler core has deterministic fixtures for REST, GraphQL, messaging, browser accessibility, and a proprietary capability. Only OpenAPI and typed host HTTP currently have real evidence/lowering adapters.
- Automatic cleanup is synthesized and lowered for HTTP workflows. The compiler has focused synthetic proof for reverse dependency chains, independent branches, and two same-type resources; runtime interruption, exactly-once cleanup, every mutation shape, and failure-point proof remain open.
- A `needs-evidence` compilation outcome is stable and non-crashing. Automatic evidence acquisition and affected-scenario recompilation are implemented with synthetic provider proof; real-provider, persisted restart, and broad reference proof remain open.
- Semantic action matching is deterministic but intentionally small; richer adapter-owned vocabularies and ontology matching need broader real-repository proof.
- UI workflow generation is grounded and executable, but complex multi-page journeys still need broader proof coverage.
- OpenAPI scenario generation handles common request/response schemas, but deeper OpenAPI and JSON Schema coverage will keep expanding.
- Contract drift detection compares OpenAPI operations with repo/runtime API routes discovered from supported JavaScript/TypeScript patterns. It now covers direct Express-style routes, nested router prefixes, `router.route(...).get(...)` chains, Nest-style controller/method decorators, and common `:id` versus `{id}` parameter route shapes. Coverage still needs expansion for dynamic route composition, generated routes, and non-JS/TS backend source discovery.
- Analytics exist as structured summaries and benchmark reports, but richer trend analytics are future work.
- Business-intent scenarios can be expressed in goals/objectives/assertions, but reusable rule IDs, rule coverage, and contradiction checks are future work.
- Scenario routing already understands `schema`, `replay`, and `custom` types. Schemathesis covers optional deep OpenAPI checking now. Built-in replay covers declared HTTP interactions.
- Message/event testing can inspect AsyncAPI channel/message contracts, run local live message publish/verify flows, and verify Pact message contracts. Broker-specific adapters are future expansion.
- Interrupted runs are finalized as recovered outcomes on the next invocation. Mid-scenario continuation is intentionally not attempted because repeating an unknown mutation would be unsafe.
- Control-plane errors are contained in the main SDK run path, but exhaustive fault injection across every optional external adapter is still being expanded.

## Not Built Yet

- AI does not execute code.
- AI-generated Playwright code is not accepted.
- AI-generated selectors are not trusted.
- Real provider quality is not compared across multiple AI models yet.
- Broader proof coverage for Specmatic service virtualization across larger apps.
- More enterprise proof apps beyond the current serious-saas, API-only, Todo, multi-tenant, e-commerce, and event/messaging set.
- Guaranteed operation when the process cannot write anywhere or the machine is permanently lost.
- Production GraphQL, browser-accessibility, broker/message, and arbitrary proprietary lowering adapters.
- A truthful guarantee that every possible application can always produce a runnable test. Unsupported or ambiguous intent is returned as a product outcome rather than guessed.

## Next Work

- Add more golden expected outputs for stable plan/result comparison.
- Add source-route discovery adapters for Python, .NET, Go, Java, and generated-route systems.
- Add deeper Specmatic stub/service-virtualization proof cases.
- Add broker-specific message adapters for Kafka, RabbitMQ, and cloud queues when those runtimes are selected.
- Add multi-provider benchmark scoring.
- Add npm publish workflow automation when release governance is ready.
